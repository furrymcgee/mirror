ldesc: "The program gst123 is designed to be a more flexible command line
player in the spirit of ogg123 and mpg123, based on GStreamer. It plays all
file formats GStreamer understands, so if you have a music collection which
contains different file formats, like flac, ogg and mp3, you can use gst123 to
play all your music files."
