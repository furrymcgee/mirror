ldesc: "CSIH (cygwin-service-installation-helper is a script
library used to assist installing cygwin services, such as sshd.
It is derived in part from various other sources. It is intended
to be 'sourced' by configuration scripts such as ssh-host-config,
syslog-config, or iu-config, and that script can then make use of
the shell functions defined by this package."
