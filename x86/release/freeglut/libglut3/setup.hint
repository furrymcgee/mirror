ldesc: "freeglut is a completely OpenSourced alternative to the OpenGL
Utility Toolkit (GLUT) library. GLUT was originally written by Mark Kilgard to
support the sample programs in the second edition OpenGL 'RedBook'. Since then,
GLUT has been used in a wide variety of practical applications because it is
simple, widely available and highly portable. GLUT (and hence freeglut) allows
the user to create and manage windows containing OpenGL contexts on a wide
range of platforms and also read the mouse, keyboard and joystick functions."
