ldesc: "Libxml2 is the XML C parser and toolkit developed for the GNOME
project. XML itself is a metalanguage to design markup languages, i.e. text
language where semantic and structure are added to the content using extra
'markup' information enclosed between angle brackets. HTML is the most well-
known markup language. Though the library is written in C, a variety of
language bindings make it available in other environments."
