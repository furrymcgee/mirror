sdesc: "Sophisticated file transfer program"
ldesc: "lftp is a sophisticated file transfer program and ftp/http/bittorrent
client.  It supports multiple network protocols.  It uses the readline library
for input, so it offers tab completion and command history.  It has job control
and bookmarks.  It can mirror sites and transfer multiple files in parallel.
It keeps trying interrupted operations until it can complete them."
