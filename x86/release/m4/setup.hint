ldesc: "An implementation of the traditional Unix macro processor. It is
mostly SVR4 compatible although it has some extensions (for example,
handling more than 9 positional parameters to macros). GNU m4 also has
built-in functions for including files, running shell commands, doing
arithmetic, etc."
