ldesc: "Ncurses (new curses) started as a freely distributable clone of
SVr4 curses. It has outgrown the clone description, and now contains many
features which are not in SVr4 curses. Curses is a pun on the term <<cursor
optimization>>. It is a library of functions that manage an application's
display on character-cell terminals (e.g., VT100)."
