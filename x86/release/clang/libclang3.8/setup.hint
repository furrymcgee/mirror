ldesc: "Clang is an LLVM native C/C++/ObjC compiler, which aims to deliver
amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to
provide a platform for building great source level tools. The Clang Static
Analyzer is a tool that automatically finds bugs in your code, and is a great
example of the sort of tool that can be built using the Clang frontend as a
library to parse C/C++ code."
