ldesc: "The Gnumeric spreadsheet is part of the GNOME desktop environment.
The goal of Gnumeric is to be the best possible spreadsheet. We are not
attempting to clone existing applications. However, Gnumeric can read files
saved with other spreadsheets and we offer a customizable feel that attempts
to minimize the costs of transition."
