sdesc: "The GNU compression utility"
ldesc: "GNU Gzip is a popular data compression program originally
written by Jean-loup Gailly for the GNU project. Mark Adler wrote the
decompression part. It was developed as a replacement for compress
because of Unisys and IBM patents covering the LZW algorithm at the
time. The superior compression ratio of gzip is just a bonus."
