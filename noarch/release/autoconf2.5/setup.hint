ldesc: "Autoconf is an extensible package of m4 macros that produce shell
scripts to automatically configure software source code packages. These scripts
can adapt the packages to many kinds of UNIX-like systems without manual user
intervention.  Autoconf creates a configuration script for a package from a
template file that lists the operating system features that the package can use,
in the form of m4 macro calls."
