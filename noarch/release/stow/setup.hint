ldesc: "Stow manages the installation of local software packages by 
creating sets of symlinks from the installed location (e.g. /usr/local) to 
a stow directory (e.g. /usr/local/stow/emacs) where the real files live. 
This allows you to keep packages separate, while making them appear to be 
installed in the same place."
